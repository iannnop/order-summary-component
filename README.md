## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The order summary component was surprisingly more difficult than the other two card components. For this challenge, I had to scrap everything and restart a few times because I was having bugs with child divs floating outside the parent div and issues with children resizing with their parents. I had to seriously take time to understand the css box-model, css grid, and css flexbox to complete this challenge. I also took the time to understand the units in CSS and when to use each one. This challenge was a good change of pace and showed me how much I didn't understand about vanilla CSS.

### Continued development

I think after this challenge, I want to move on to much larger layouts with many different components. I've started to imagine boxes around each element and understood when and where to add margin or padding. I think I need more practice with Flexbox and CSS Grid with larger layouts, but I'm starting to build these projects quicker with a better understanding of how to position everything. I really need to clean up my css code though. I feel like it gets messier as I continue to tweak everything to match the design.
